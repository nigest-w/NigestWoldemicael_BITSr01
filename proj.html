    <h2> My Bio</h2>
    
    <p>Being in the field of computing, I am very interested and i am also interested
     in things that can be seen and new things that attract me.
    Even though i don't have the knowledge of the field i am in before, 
    but now i have better skills and i am trying to do new things.   
    I have the ability to understand and accept quickly. 
I know some languages  HTML,Java, CSS, JS, and i have basic knowledge of  
     React mobile app . I want to reach a big level in my career.
 I think it is better to do something that will benefit many people besides me, and 
     I think that this training will increase my ability</p>
